# ðŸ“Š Exploratory Data Analysis & Data Ingestion using MS SQL

Welcome to the EDA-MS-SQL-DataIngestion project!
This repository presents a practical walkthrough of transitioning from manual Excel-based business reporting to a structured database solution using Microsoft SQL Server(which is connected to Power BI dashboard). It covers the end-to-end process of data ingestion, cleaning, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to enable faster, more reliable reporting and insights.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

In this project, I focused on:

- Building a clean and scalable data ingestion pipeline in MS SQL.
- Running SQL-based transformations and data cleaning.
- Performing meaningful exploratory data analysis to uncover business insights.
- Optimizing performance and writing clean SQL queries for analytics.

The dataset used simulates business transactional data, perfect for demonstrating real-world analytics techniques.
